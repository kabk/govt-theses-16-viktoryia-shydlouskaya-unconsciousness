    <p>Abstract:

<p>There is something inside each of us that secretly drives us, keeps us going in a certain direction or makes us stay still in the middle of nowhere; lighting the way in our imagination or blurring the imaginary road out. There is something that has hidden access to our emotions, senses and feelings; some under-mind processes that correspond with our free will, pleasure and desires. Something in our mind that gets our trust, without asking for permission, and influences thought processes, memory, affect and motivation. These processes of the mind occur automatically and are not available for introspection.</p>

<p>The time that we are living in gives us the possibility to talk about such things as an unconscious mind on a scientific level. XX century cognitive psychology with neurology made it possible to enter into one of the biggest challenges for science of the XXI century: understanding a human mind in biological terms.</p>

<p>I strongly believe that one of the reasons people are so motivated to understand themselves is the desire to understand others and vice versa. The art culture has this form of relationship primarily in its structure. We see it in the dialog between the work of art and the artist himself, the viewer and the object of observation or an experience, and finally the artist and the beholder’s share.</p>

<p>Getting the perfect connection in any dialog is usually its main goal. Design (graphic) is no exception; this playground includes lots of discussions with such an aim. Understanding the viewer, client and user of the product that we create, and possibly of which we control the responses, makes a work successful and professional. Getting attention, holding it, making an experience interesting, maintaining a positive impression, and realizing certain educational processes are only a few examples of the objectives that visual communication workers are trying to meet. All of them are in one way or another connected to design practice and are always open to improvement.</p>

<p>This research thesis poses several general questions, based on the connection between knowledge of the unconscious mind and design practice, such as: “Can it actually be relevant and useful?” “Is there a connection?” “What is the point of contact of these topics?” and “Can this knowledge really be in any way useful for the creative processes?” This finally leads to the key research question: “To what extent does knowledge of the unconscious mind influence the design practice?” It builds up the dialog between brain science and art culture, mainly using the information about mental images, psychology of art, visual perception and its principles, gestalt theory and subliminal perceptions.</p>

      Prologue 
<p>Amachure self analisys: The portrait of the internal traitor.</p>

<p>(Within the prologue I would like to give a hint and set a tone of the main topic trough personal connection to it. “How I met my internal traitor” is a story about facing the unconscious mind. It describes why do I call it traitor and how it become the topic of my graduation (graphic design) thesis. For those who would like to skip this part due to lack of interest of this information, it won’t influence on understanding the further thesis content. Because of it, the prologue will be possible in use only in process of writing in order to help myself be more specific and make as concrete point as possible.)</p>

<p>A sign of sanity.</p>
<p>Have you ever tried to talk with yourself? In order to clarify your thought or in a search of the way out of one or another situation, have you ask yourself: What to do? How to do it? Why am I doing it?</p>

<p>Usually I hear back the voice of my mother, sometimes dad, or friends… it might be my own voice, but more likely I will hear the answers of those who usually having a dialogue with me. I know, this answers in my mind, builds out of an opinions that I have as the memory storage and formulates according to it. I understand myself as nothing more than a set of my own memory combination, result of my sensors receives, what I have heart, felt and seen.
This voices in my mind, that I listen to, feelings I believe to, aren't my mom, dad or anyone else, it is my internal traitor, my unconscious mind that giving me a hint of my nature and talking on the language of my internal truth.
I call it a traitor not because it is against me but because are likely I am against it. While escaping the understanding of my own nature, of its minuses and non-perfection I am creating imaginary self in the only one who keep being natural inside me is this brain processes. It is won’t hide my fear, but also won't leave me in the desperation, it have more direct accesses to my memory, therefore much more in control than conscious me.</p>

<p>“They” have had teaches me being honest, listen own “Self”, and start everything I does from it. There for, not the narcissism, but the believes I have, leads me to begin this writing from the one in the mirror. </p>

<p>It is summer 2015, I am setting in front of my laptop in studio that takes place in The Hague (NL), few thousand kilometres from the place I have born and grew up. I am looking at my typing fingers; my hands have a green and a blue colour tone, because of the paint, that doesn’t go away easily; it is late evening, my windows are open and lamp making warm light around; near me standing a table with strong smell of oil paint set, and this is how I’m facing my second graphic design bachelor graduation time.</p>

<p>In search of the ground.</p>
<p>It started 9 years ago, between a “thousand and one” activity I have had as a teenager, I naturally end up with one. The one that brings me back to myself, after I would dive into it fully, and because so - felt the most right one. That was visual art and all that connect to its culture. This decision would be comparable to the way we comes to one or another faith and feels exactly like this. </p>

<p>Making a choice or coming to certain decision in life, we are naturally searching for confirmation from the outside. One of my favourite references, according to faith, belongs to Lev Tolstoy “Confession”:</p>

<p>“…As I now look back at that time I clearly see that apart from animal instincts, the faith that affected my life, the only real faith I had, was faith in perfection. But I could not have said what perfection consisted of or what its purpose might be. I tried to achieve intellectual perfection; I studied everything I could, everything that life gave me a chance to study. I tried to perfect my will and set up rules for myself that I endeavoured to follow. I strove for physical perfection by doing all the exercises that develop strength and agility and by undergoing all the hardships that discipline the self in endurance and perseverance. I took all this to be perfection.”</p>

<p>The passion to find some sort of way to exist in harmony with your "own nature", and therefore search for this "nature" so devotedly has always fascinated me in humans. I strongly believe that one of the reasons people are so motivated to understand themselves is the desire to understand others and vice versa.</p>

<p>Getting the perfect connection in any dialog is usually its main goal. Design (graphic) is no exception; this playground includes lots of discussions with such an aim. Understanding the viewer, client and user of the product that we create, and possibly of which we control the responses, makes a work successful and professional. Getting attention, holding it, making an experience interesting, maintaining a positive impression, and realizing certain educational processes are only a few examples of the objectives that visual communication workers are trying to meet. All of them are in one way or another connected to design practice and are always open to improvement.</p>

    <p>Introduction.</p>

<p>(After telling the story that personally connect me to the subject of the unconscious mind I would like to make an introduction to the thesis specifically. Here I define the design practice as the fundamental base that will relate all the following constructions of this text. The introduction draws a system of the thesis witch suggested by the research question: exploring the unconscious mind knowledge, examine an investigation to the design practise).</p>

<p>We are living in the world of fast communication, mass production and global consumption. There is an incredible amount of information surround us that is constantly suggesting itself and tries to be as productive, in grabbing our attention, as possible. Graphic Design very much transforms and changes its position in visual communication culture with in the technological progress. The individual artist or any kind of agency that dealing with graphic design can hardly compare their way of thinking and form of activity with their colleagues that was actual 10-15 years ago. And if this is not something we can relay the critical moment to, than the fact that graphic design becoming more and more multidisciplinary felt can open the discussion for this thesis.</p>

<p>The research question for this thesis is: To what extent can the knowledge about unconscious mind influences the design practice?
</p>

<p>As the practice that dealing with visual communication, and organization of it, graphic design can hardly avoid the possibility to apply such a promising source of capacity as the knowledge about the unconscious mind. This, in first place scientific, study includes an incredible amount of information that can be useful in the issues that we as a graphic designers dealing with. Such as: creativity, actuality, practicality, productivity and many others.</p>

<p>On the way to answering the questions that this thesis raised, first of all will be the defined the unconscious mind. The first chapter will be telling the concept of the human brain phenomena from different angle and perspective. By describing the various manifestations and the known processes of the unconscious mind, the reader will gradually get to its form-expression in art. </p>

<p>From the general information reader will be guided to the perception of psychoanalysis and Sigmund Freud point of view on art. The main character of witch the artist and its nature with in the psychoanalysis basic tenets. </p>  

<p>Second chapter will be open up further investigation on the scientific research about unconscious mind and in general brain science to art and design. The main sours of the research for it will be: “The Age of Insight: The Quest to Understand the Unconscious in Art, Mind, and Brain, from Vienna 1900 to the Present.” – book by Nobel Prize winner Eric R. Kandel. This book where leaders in science, medicine, and art began a revolution that changed forever how we think about the human mind—our conscious and unconscious thoughts and emotions—and how mind and brain relate to art. Erick R. Kandel brilliantly connected all the points in science and art history that was in common and this exploration of him prissles for this thesis writing.</p>

<p>“The Age of Insight” will give us some examples from painting art and specifically portraiture with in the investigation of the science of the mind by such an artists like Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka and Egon Schiele.</p>

<p>From there on the story will take another part of the psychological study of the mind – Mental imagery (Chapter 3). The knowledge of which is used in lots of way of unconscious manipulation in art and design perception, such as subliminal messaging or ironic process theory, for instance. </p>

<p>As more we know as more questions are raised. The mental images are based on the visual information that storage in our memory. In order to explore the income for our memory storage we have to understand the way we receive the information from the environment This process are equipped with sense organs e.g. eye, ear, nose. Each sense organ is part of a sensory system which receives sensory inputs and transmits sensory information to the brain. Chapter 4 will It will be devoted to this topic and also will be exploring the visual memory, bottom up and top-down processes.</p>

<p>The theory that will bring us closer to the conclusion is the Gestalt theory.</p>

<p>The majority of the principles that mind and brain sciences (cognitive psychology with neurology) was opened up for us in last two century will be explored and applied to the creative process of artist and the Beholder’s share.</p>

<p>It is rather critical than objective knowledge but as we will see they cost a lot of power to be known and used, despite its ambiguity.</p>
