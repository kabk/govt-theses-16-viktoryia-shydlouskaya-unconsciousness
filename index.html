<p>There is something inside each of us that secretly drives us, keeps us going in a certain direction or makes us stay still in the middle of nowhere; lighting the way in our imagination or blurring the imaginary road out. There is something that has hidden access to our emotions, senses and feelings; some under-mind processes that correspond with our free will, pleasure and desires. Something in our mind that gets our trust, without asking for permission, and influences thought processes, memory, affect and motivation. These processes of the mind occur automatically and are not available for introspection.</p>

<p>The time that we are living in gives us the possibility to talk about such things as an unconscious mind on a scientific level. XX century cognitive psychology with neurology made it possible to enter into one of the biggest challenges for science of the XXI century: understanding a human mind in biological terms. </p>

<p>I strongly believe that one of the reasons people are so motivated to understand themselves is the desire to understand others and vice versa. The art culture has this form of relationship primarily in its structure. We see it in the dialogue between the work of art and the artist himself, the viewer and the object of observation or an experience, and finally between the artist and the beholder’s share. </p>

<p>Getting the perfect connection in any dialog is usually its main goal. Design (graphic) is no exception; this playground includes lots of discussions with such an aim. Understanding the viewer, client and user of the product that we creates, and possibly of which we control the responses, makes a work successful and professional. Getting attention, holding it, making an experience interesting, maintaining a positive impression, and realizing certain educational processes are only a few examples of the objectives that visual communication workers are trying to meet. All of them are in one way or another connected to design practice and are always open to improvement. </p>

<p>This research thesis poses several general questions, based on the connection between knowledge of the unconscious mind and design practice, such as: “Can it actually be relevant and useful?” “Is there a connection?” “What is the point of contact of these topics?” and “Can this knowledge really be in any way useful for the creative processes?” This finally leads to the key research question: “To what extent does knowledge of the unconscious mind influence the design practice?” It builds up the dialog between brain science and art culture, mainly using the information about mental images, psychology of art, visual perception and its principles. </p>

   <h4>The portrait of the internal traitor.</h4> 
   <img class="pixel" src="abstract.jpg" alt="abstract" style="display:none;">
<p>(Within the prologue I would like to give a hint and set a tone of the main topic trough personal connection to it. “How I met my internal traitor” is a story on facing the unconscious mind. It describes why do I call it traitor and how it become the topic of my graduation (graphic design) thesis. For those who would like to skip this part due to lack of interest of this information, it won’t influence on understanding the further thesis content. Because of it, the prologue will be possible in use only in process of writing in order to help myself be more specific and make as concrete point as possible.)</p>

<p>A sign of sanity.
Have you ever tried to talk with yourself? In order to clarify your thought, or in search of the way out of one or another situation, have you ever asked yourself questions out loud?</p>

<p>Usually I hear back the voice of my mother, sometimes dad, brother or friends… it might be my own voice, but more likely I will hear the answers of those who usually having a dialogue with me. I know, this answers in my mind, builds out of an opinions that I have as the memory storage and formulates according to it. I understand myself as nothing more than a set of my own memory combination, result of my sensors receives, what I have heart, felt and seen.</p>

<p>“They” have had teaches me being honest, listen own “Self”, and start everything I does from it. There for, not the narcissism, but the believes I have, leads me to begin this writing from the one in the mirror. </p>

<p>It is summer 2015, I am setting in front of my laptop in studio that takes place in The Hague (NL), few thousand kilometres from the place I have born and grew up. I am looking at my typing fingers; my hands have a green and a blue colour tone, because of the paint, that doesn’t go away easily; it is late evening, my windows are open and lamp making warm light around; near me standing a table with strong smell of oil paint set, and this is how I’m facing my second graphic design bachelor graduation time.</p>

<p>In search of the ground.
It started 9 years ago, between a “thousand and one” activity I have had as a teenager, I naturally end up with one. The one that brings me back to myself, after I would dive into it fully, and because so - felt the most right one. That was visual art and all that connect to its culture. This decision would be comparable to the way we comes to one or another faith and feels exactly like this. </p>

<p>Making a choice or coming to certain decision in life, we are naturally searching for confirmation from the outside. One of my favourite references, according to faith, belongs to Lev Tolstoy “Confession”:</p>

<p>“…As I now look back at that time I clearly see that apart from animal instincts, the faith that affected my life, the only real faith I had, was faith in perfection. But I could not have said what perfection consisted of or what its purpose might be. I tried to achieve intellectual perfection; I studied everything I could, everything that life gave me a chance to study. I tried to perfect my will and set up rules for myself that I endeavoured to follow. I strove for physical perfection by doing all the exercises that develop strength and agility and by undergoing all the hardships that discipline the self in endurance and perseverance. I took all this to be perfection.”</p>

<p>The passion to find some sort of way to exist in harmony with your "own nature", and therefore search for this "nature" so devotedly has always fascinated me in humans. I strongly believe that one of the reasons people are so motivated to understand themselves is the desire to understand others and vice versa.</p>

<p>Getting the perfect connection in any dialog is usually its main goal. Design (graphic) is no exception; this playground includes lots of discussions with such an aim. Understanding the viewer, client and user of the product that we create, and possibly of which we control the responses, makes a work successful and professional. Getting attention, holding it, making an experience interesting, maintaining a positive impression, and realizing certain educational processes are only a few examples of the objectives that visual communication workers are trying to meet. All of them are in one way or another connected to design practice and are always open to improvement.

   <h4></h4> 
<p>(After telling the story that personally connect me to the subject of the unconscious mind I would like to make an introduction to the thesis specifically. Here I define the design practice as the fundamental base that will relate all the following constructions of this text. The introduction draws a system of the thesis witch suggested by the research question: exploring the unconscious mind knowledge, examine an investigation to the design practise).</p>

<p>We are living in the world of fast communication, mass production and global consumption. There is an incredible amount of information surround us that is constantly suggesting itself (selling) and tries to be as productive, in grabbing our attention, as possible. Graphic Design very much transforms and changes its position in visual communication culture with in the technological progress. The individual artist or design agency can hardly compare their way of thinking and form of activity with their colleagues that was active 10-15 years ago.</p>

<p>The research question for this thesis is: To what extent can the knowledge about unconscious mind influences the design practice?</p>

<p>As the practice that dealing with visual communication, and organization of it, graphic design can hardly avoid the possibility to apply such a promising source of capacity as the knowledge about the unconscious mind. This, in first place scientific, study includes an incredible amount of information that can be useful in the issues that we as a graphic designers dealing with. Such as: creativity, actuality, practicality, productivity and many others.</p>

<p>On the way to answering the questions that this thesis raised, first of all will be the defined the unconscious mind. The first chapter will be telling the concept of the human brain phenomena from different angle and perspective. By describing the various manifestations and the known processes of the unconscious mind, the reader will gradually get to its form-expression in art.</p> 

<p>From the general information reader will be guided to the perception of psychoanalysis and Sigmund Freud point of view on art. The main character of witch the artist and its nature with in the psychoanalysis basic tenets.</p>   

<p>Second chapter will be open up further investigation on the scientific research about unconscious mind and in general brain science to art and design. The main sours of the research for it will be: “The Age of Insight: The Quest to Understand the Unconscious in Art, Mind, and Brain, from Vienna 1900 to the Present.” – book by Nobel Prize winner Eric R. Kandel. This book where leaders in science, medicine, and art began a revolution that changed forever how we think about the human mind—our conscious and unconscious thoughts and emotions—and how mind and brain relate to art. Erick R. Kandel brilliantly connected all the points in science and art history that was in common and this exploration of him prissles for this thesis writing.</p>

<p>“The Age of Insight” will give us some examples from painting art and specifically portraiture with in the investigation of the science of the mind by such an artists like Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka and Egon Schiele.</p>

<p>From there on the story will take another part of the psychological study of the mind – Mental imagery (Chapter 3). The knowledge of which is used in lots of way of unconscious manipulation in art and design perception, such as subliminal messaging or ironic process theory, for instance. </p>

<p>As more we know as more questions are raised. The mental images are based on the visual information that storage in our memory. In order to explore the income for our memory storage we have to understand the way we receive the information from the environment This process are equipped with sense organs e.g. eye, ear, nose. Each sense organ is part of a sensory system which receives sensory inputs and transmits sensory information to the brain. Chapter 4 will It will be devoted to this topic and also will be exploring the visual memory, bottom up and top-down processes.</p>

<p>The theory that will bring us closer to the conclusion is the Gestalt theory. </p>

<p>The majority of the principles that mind and brain sciences (cognitive psychology with neurology) was opened up for us in last two century will be explored and applied to the creative process of artist and the Beholder’s share. </p>

<p>It is rather critical than objective knowledge but as we will see they cost a lot of power to be known and used, despite its ambiguity.

   <h4>The unconscious mind. (Define the internal traitor) </h4> 
<p>(To start exploring the details of this thesis from the very beginning I will start with defining the unconscious mind. What is the unconscious mind (metaphor: The internal traitor)?).</p>

<p>((1: I start with a short example of the imagination where the unconscious mind plain the main role, so that the definition will be related to the existing mental image.)
At the moment when we are encounter with the adversity or danger, our fear takes over our imagination. This happens instantly, instinctively. First think, we want to know and be aware for, is what can possible happens to us, and because so, we instantly sort out all possibilities, until we stops on something that satisfy our imagination. Even if it is not absolute truth, our brain suggested the most logical option and we trust it. We want to control the situation to be able to survive and defend ourselves. Once we have experienced this moment, once we met with the worst imagination, we already know what we're dealing with. The next thing that usually happens to us is the idea of resolving the problem. Some sort of visualization therapy with a positive outcome suggestion. In this moment, our mind trying to find a way out from the terrible situation, that scared us just a second ago. As a rule, we start to feel better, more conscious and aware of the reality.</p>

<p>(The first image, just as another one, builds out of our memory sources. There is nothing more or less then the information that contain our mind, whether we aware of it or it is something that hidden in the back of our mind. The only wrong to think is that we consciously holding the control of this mental imagery construction.</p>

<p>((2: building metaphor and collecting possible informal definitions to come closer to the reader personal connection)
There is something inside each of us that secretly drives us, keeps us going in a certain direction or makes us stay still in the middle of nowhere; lighting the way in our imagination or blurring the imaginary road out. There is something that has hidden access to our emotions, senses and feelings; some under-mind processes that correspond with our free will, pleasure and desires. Something in our mind that gets our trust, without asking for permission </p>

<p>((3: history and relevance of the subject)
The question of human mind psychology, structure and nature of it, is there for a long time. People discovered the field, given that phenomena a place in their life issues, naturally interested in it because this mind processes is an integral part of their existence, impossible to ignore and skip. One of them, who inquired, was 18th-century German Romantic philosopher Friedrich Schelling. He was the first one who gave it a term - "unconscious" (German: Unbewusste) .</p>

<p>((4: scientific definition of the term)
The unconscious mind (or the unconscious) consists of the processes in the mind which occurs automatically and are not available to introspection, and include thought processes, memory, affect, and motivation .</p>

<p>((5: actuality)
The time that we are living in gives us the possibility to talk about such things as an unconscious mind on a scientific level. XX century cognitive psychology (the science of the mind) with neurology (the science of the brain) made it possible to enter into one of the biggest challenges for science of the XXI century: understanding a human mind in biological terms. This science allowd us to dress a range of questions about ourselves, such as : How do we perceive, learn and remember?; What is a nature of emotion,  empathy, consciousness?  </p>

    
   <h4>1.1 Exploring the Psychology of the internal traitor.</h4> 
<p>(1.1: Main figure of exploration the unconscious mind in psychology)
The one, who popularized the concept of unconscious mind, was the Austrian neurologist and psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud (1856 – 1939). Freud's unconsciousness theory often visualised as the image of an iceberg, and represents the idea of it: most of the human mind operates unconsciously. </p>

<p>In his student life at Vienna school of medicine, Sigmund Freud started from describing mental life in basic neurobiological terms. Later, he developed a new psychology of mind that was independent of the biology of the brain  - Psychoanalysis (set of psychological and psychotherapeutic theories and associated techniques).  It is a psychotherapeutic method developed for the treatment of psychoneuroses. </p>

<p>(1.2: The knowledge about such a thing as psychoanalysis is quit broad for this text but I have to point on its main principles in order to be able later relate to this base in discussion about the psychoanalysis in relation to art, artist and the viewer.)</p>

<p>The basic tenets of psychoanalysis include:</p>
<p>• A person's development is determined by often forgotten events in
early childhood rather than by inherited traits alone.</p>
<p>• Human attitude, mannerism, experience, and thought is largely influenced by irrational drives that are rooted in the unconscious</p>
<p>• It is necessary to bypass psychological resistance in the form of defence mechanisms when bringing drives into awareness.</p>
<p>• Conflicts between the conscious and the unconscious, or with repressed material can materialize in the form of mental or emotional disturbances, for example: neurosis, neurotic traits, anxiety, depression etc.</p>
<p>• Liberating the elements of the unconscious is achieved through bringing this material into the conscious mind (via e.g. skilled guidance, i.e. therapeutic intervention). </p>
<p>According to psychoanalysis, unconscious processes are operating in dreams in a in metaphors and symbols, as well as in slips  of the tongue and jokes. That means that unconscious mind, according to Freud, can be seen as the source of dreams and automatic thoughts (those that appear without any apparent cause), the repository of forgotten memories (that may still be accessible to consciousness at some later time), and the locus of implicit knowledge (the things that we have learned so well that we do them without thinking) .</p>

   <h4>1.2. Freud / psychoanalysis and art</h4> 
<p>(this sub-chapter will be a short introduction to the unconscious mind with in the connection to art. It is part with in the information about relation between psychoanalysis and art mainly from the artist side (the creation). The viewer side (the perception) will be open briefly e.g. the global interest in the beholder’s share was discovered a bit later.)
As a psychological system that chose the subject of its study the unconscious mind processes and its manifestations, psychoanalysis seductively fits for applying its methods to interpret questions of art.</p>

<p>“I could describe its colour and its shape and its size, 
but there’s nothing that can approximate the experience 
of standing in front of that painting” </p>
<p>Until we limited the analysis of the processes occurring in the couscous mind, we can hardly find the answer to the most basic questions about the psychology of art. Neither from the artist nor the viewer, we can hardly find out what is the essence of the art experience. It wouldn’t be strange to assume that most significant aspect of art lies in the fact that the process of its creation and the process of using them are inexplicable and hidden from the consciousness. </p>

<p>We will never be able to say exactly why we liked this or that work of art or design product; words almost can’t express any significant and important aspects of the experience. All the attempts are grows into interpretation, description of known human feelings and emotions. Each of this interpretation is based on an individual memory and therefore purely subjective.</p>

<p>Psychoanalysis is a psychological system that is the subject of his study elected unconscious life and its manifestations. It is feels right that psychoanalysis was particularly tempting to try to apply its method to interpret the questions of art. Until now, psychoanalysis had to deal with two major manifestations of the unconscious facts - dreaming and neurosis. The first and second form it understood and interpreted as a famous compromise or conflict between unconscious and conscious. 
Psychoanalysts from this and began by arguing that art occupies a middle place between dream and neurosis, and that it is based on a conflict that already "overripe for a dream, but has not yet become pathogenic." It also, as in these two forms appears unconscious, but only in a different way, although it is quite the same nature. "Thus, the artist psychologically stands between the dreamer and the neurotic; psychological process in which substantially the same, it is only the difference in the degree ... ". </p>

<p>Freud points to the two forms of the unconscious and change reality, which are suitable for art closer than a dream and neurosis, and calls the child's play and fantasy in reality. "It is unfair to think - he says - that the child looks at the world he created is not serious; on the contrary, it refers to the game very seriously, making it a lot of animation. Opposition of the game is not serious, but - reality. Child well-distinguished, despite all the passion, he created the world from the real and eagerly seeks support for imaginary objects and relations in the tangible and visible things of real life ... The poet does the same as the child plays, he creates a world to which the very seriously, that is making a lot of enthusiasm at the same time, sharply separating it from reality. " </p>

<p>It is right to note that the one who dreams are not the one who happy, but only who unsatisfied with life. Unsatisfied desires - incentive stimulus fantasy. Each fantasy - is the realization of desires, adjustments to the unsatisfying reality. Thus Freud believes that the basis of poetry, as well as the basis of a dream and fantasy are unsatisfied desires, often such "we are ashamed that we have to hide from themselves and which therefore pushed into the unconscious."  
Just as in a dream awaken this desire, which we are ashamed, as they say, and the arts are reflected only those desires that cannot be met by direct means. Hence it is clear that art is always dealing with a criminal, shameful, rejected. And just as in a dream repressed desires manifest themselves in a highly distorted form, as precisely in the artwork they appear disguised form. "After scientific research - says Freud - were able to establish the distortion of dreams, it is easy to see that dreams are the same realization of desires, like" waking dreams ", we are all familiar fantasy." In the same way, and the artist, in order to give satisfaction to their repressed desires must clothe them into an art form, which from the point of view of psychoanalysis has two basic meanings.</p>
<p>Firstly, this form should provide a shallow and superficial, as if self-contained pleasure pure sensual order and serve as bait, the promised award or, more correctly, the preliminary pleasure, luring readers into a hard and heavy matter of acting out unconscious.</p>
<p>Other its purpose is to create an artificial disguise, a compromise that allows to show up and forbidden desires and yet cheat pre-emptive censorship of consciousness.</p>

<p>This part can and should me shorter and more precise to the point. </p>

   <h4>Unconscious psychology and Art</h4> 
<h4>2.0 The Age from insight</h4>

<p>(The Age of Insight: The Quest to Understand the Unconscious in Art, Mind, and Brain, from Vienna 1900 to the Present. – book by Nobel Prize winner Eric R. Kandel. where leaders in science, medicine, and art began a revolution that changed forever how we think about the human mind—our conscious and unconscious thoughts and emotions—and how mind and brain relate to art. This book directly connected to my research for the thesis. It is specified on the portraiture and certain period in history but contain all the knowledge possibly can be used in artistic research according human mind. I found all I can prove according my subject in this book and would like to make a chapter as a personal review on the book as the bases of the information I used. This chapter are not developed yet.) </p>

<p>Human being are not rational creatures; they are driven by irrational unconscious mental processes. That is what the Viennese scientist were working on in the end of XX, beginning of XXI century.</p>

<p>This new biological science of mind important, argue Kandel, not only because it provides us with a dipper understanding of what makes us who we are, but also because it makes possible a series of meaningful dialogue between brain science and other arias of knowledge. In a larger sense this dialogue could help make science a part our common cultural experience.
</p>

<h4>2.1 :“THE BEHOLDER’S SHARE”</h4>

<p>(This sub-chapter belong to Chapter 2 and are not developed yet.)
Austrian art historian Alois Riegl was one of the first who attempted to build the bridge between the author and the viewer through science. He had an idea in his mind that science involvement to the art will save it future progress and will positively influence on cultural development. The science art supposed to relate itself, in his strong opinion, was psychology and and the problem it must focus from so on is the response of the viewer.</p>

<p>Alois Riegl began to develop a theory of “attentiveness” to describe the relationship between the viewer of a work of art and the work itself. He introduce his idea as “the beholder’s share” concept, that denotes that part of an artwork’s meaning which must be contributed by the viewer. The documentation of unrealised and in some cases impossible works in this exhibition is intended to provoke an exploration of this latent potential which exists even when the work itself does not.</p>

<p>“ The painter paints a work of art but a work of art is not complete unless the viewer response to it”, says Alois. He called it “the Beholder’s share” because each one is a share in artistic culture, the painter and the beholder. And he thought that the trying to understand what the beholder response towards work of ours is the key to art history.</p>

<p>He argued that are, particularly post Renaissance art, invited the viewers participation. He now saw the Beholder’s Share as the key problem to focus on for a scientific approach to art because the beholder’s response is essential for the completion of the picture.</p>

<p>This challenge was taken up by two great disciples of Riegel: Ernst Kris and Ernst Gombrich.</p>



<h4>2.2: ART IS AMBIGUOUS</h4>

<p>(This sub-chapter belong to Chapter 2 and are not developed yet.)
Ernst Kris was practice as a psychoanalyst, and he also worked as an art historian and published articles on art history</p>

<p>“Great art is Ambiguous.
Ambiguity allows for alternative views on the part of different beholders, and these differences in the beholder’s response reveals creativity in the beholder’s share.
Thus The Beholder recapitulates in his own brain a creative process which parallels that of the artist.”</p>

<p>The simple example of complicated structure will make it clear: If one of you and I look at the same painting we will respond differently to it, why is that true? We, each of us, bring different life experience, different experiences to art to being, our experiences in observation including experience in looking at work of art. So we convey that experience on our impression, it influence our impression. In fact Kris says that the beholder in looking in a work of art undergoes an creative experience that is in small parts a recreation capable to the artist. The artist off course create such a great act of the art but every time you look at the painting you yourself undergoing a creative act that is in small way a recapitulation what the artist does.</p>

 
<p>2.3 Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka and Egon Schiele
(This sub-chapter belong to Chapter 2 and are not developed yet.)</p>

<p>Gustav Klimt:
* Artists and the practical search in expressing unconscious, inside processes. Science impact on art. Examples.
- Not surprisingly, the closest artists to the new scientific invention in art was Viennese.
- Gustav Klimt was influenced by ideas of his time and surroundings and in some way, we can suggest, if mostly formulate his “creation voice tone”.
- The great leader of Vienna school of medicine, Rokitansky, influenced not only Freud but also Klimt. </p>
