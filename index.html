Title: “The surface of insight”

Research question: To what extent does knowledge of the unconscious mind influence the design practice?

Abstract:

There is something inside each of us that secretly drives us, keeps us going in a certain direction or makes us stay still in the middle of nowhere; lighting the way in our imagination or blurring the imaginary road. There is something that has hidden access to our emotions, senses and feelings; some under-mind processes that correspond with our free will, pleasure and desires. Something in our mind that gets our trust, without asking for permission, and influences thought processes, memory, affect and moti...(line truncated)...

The time that we are living in gives us the possibility to talk about such things as an unconscious mind on a scientific level. XX century cognitive psychology with neurology made it possible to enter into one of the biggest challenges for science of the XXI century: understanding a human mind in biological terms.

I strongly believe that one of the reasons people are so motivated to understand themselves is the desire to understand others and vice versa. The art culture has this form of relationship primarily in its structure. The dialog between the work of art and the artist himself, the viewer and the object of observation or an experience, and finally the artist and the beholder’s share.

Getting the perfect connection in any dialog is usually its main goal. Design (graphic) is no exception; this playground includes lots of discussions with such an aim. Understanding the viewer, client and user of the product that we create, and possibly of which we control the responses, makes a work successful and professional. Getting attention, holding it, making an experience interesting, maintaining a positive impression, and realizing certain educational processes are only a few examples of the object...(line truncated)...

This research thesis poses several general questions, based on the connection between knowledge of the unconscious mind and design practice, such as: “Can it actually be relevant and useful?” “Is there a connection?” “What is the point of contact of these topics?” and “Can this knowledge really be in any way useful for an art activity?” This finally leads to the key research question: “To what extent does knowledge of the unconscious mind influence the design practice?” It builds up the dialog between brain...(line truncated)...
