    <h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>We are living in the world of fast communication, mass production and global consumption. There is an incredible amount of information surround us that is constantly suggesting itself and tries to be as productive, in grabbing our attention, as possible. Graphic Design very much transforms and changes its position in visual communication culture with in the technological progress. The individual artist or any kind of agency that dealing with graphic design can hardly compare their way of thinking and form of activity with their colleagues that was actual 10-15 years ago. And if this is not something we can relay the critical moment to, than the fact that graphic design becoming more and more multidisciplinary felt can open the discussion for this thesis.</p>

<p>The research question for this thesis is: To what extent can the knowledge about unconscious mind influences the design practice?</p>

<p>As the practice that dealing with visual communication, and organization of it, graphic design can hardly avoid the possibility to apply such a promising source of capacity as the knowledge about the unconscious mind. This, in first place scientific, study includes an incredible amount of information that can be useful in the issues that we as a graphic designers dealing with. Such as: creativity, actuality, practicality, productivity and many others.</p>

<p>On the way to answering the questions that this thesis raised, first of all will be the defined the unconscious mind. The first chapter will be telling the concept of the human brain phenomena from different angle and perspective. By describing the various manifestations and the known processes of the unconscious mind, the reader will gradually get to its form-expression in art. </p>

<p>Second chapter will be open up further investigation on the scientific research about unconscious mind and in general brain science to art and design. The main sours of the research for it will be: “The Age of Insight: The Quest to Understand the Unconscious in Art, Mind, and Brain, from Vienna 1900 to the Present.” – book by Nobel Prize winner Eric R. Kandel. This book where leaders in science, medicine, and art began a revolution that changed forever how we think about the human mind—our conscious and unconscious thoughts and emotions—and how mind and brain relate to art. Erick R. Kandel brilliantly connected all the points in science and art history that was in common and this exploration of him prissles for this thesis writing.</p>

<p>“The Age of Insight” will give us some examples from painting art and specifically portraiture with in the investigation of the science of the mind by such an artists like Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka and Egon Schiele.</p>

<p>From there on the story will take another part of the psychological study of the mind – Mental imagery (Chapter 3). The knowledge of which is used in lots of way of unconscious manipulation in art and design perception, such as subliminal messaging or ironic process theory, for instance. 
</p>

<p>As more we know as more questions are raised. The mental images are based on the visual information that storage in our memory. In order to explore the income for our memory storage we have to understand the way we receive the information from the environment This process are equipped with sense organs e.g. eye, ear, nose. Each sense organ is part of a sensory system which receives sensory inputs and transmits sensory information to the brain. Chapter 4 will It will be devoted to this topic and also will be exploring the visual memory, bottom up and top-down processes.</p>

<p>The theory that will bring us closer to the conclusion is the Gestalt theory.</p>

<p>The majority of the principles that mind and brain sciences (cognitive psychology with neurology) was opened up for us in last two century will be explored and applied to the creative process of artist and the Beholder’s share. </p>

<p>It is rather critical than objective knowledge but as we will see they cost a lot of power to be known and used, despite its ambiguity. </p>

<h1>“WE THINK ONLY IN SIGNS” <br /></h1>

<p>The Martians, however, haven't had the same cultural evolution as we did and to them the dove could signify a completely different concept. In this case it's apparently the opposite of peace. Or they might have recognized the dove as a weapon of some sorts, seeing as it is highly improbable there are white doves on Mars. Thinking that extraterrestrials will understand any of our own habitual ways of communication might prove to be a big misconception. The arrow on the pioneer plaque for example (img), is a typical anthropocentric symbol, which is derived from our historic usage of arrows for hunting, and which to us has become a way of pointing out a certain direction. To us, this seems clear, but to a lifeform that has another way of conveying direction it might be confusing.
A way to solve this would be to explain how an arrow works. In a static way, this could be done by looking at the universe and its many occurences in which direction plays an important part. The orbits of planets, or the path of a meteoroid. These can be used to explain the directional message of an arrow. (example)</p>
