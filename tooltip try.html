    <h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>We are living in the world of fast communication, mass production and global consumption. There is an incredible amount of information surround us that is constantly suggesting itself and tries to be as productive, in grabbing our attention, as possible. Graphic Design very much transforms and changes its position in visual communication culture with in the technological progress. The individual artist or any kind of agency that dealing with graphic design can hardly compare their way of thinking and form of activity with their colleagues that was actual 10-15 years ago. And if this is not something we can relay the critical moment to, than the fact that graphic design becoming more and more multidisciplinary felt can open the discussion for this thesis.</p>

<p>The research question for this thesis is: To what extent can the knowledge about unconscious mind influences the design practice?</p>

<p>As the practice that dealing with visual communication, and organization of it, graphic design can hardly avoid the possibility to apply such a promising source of capacity as the knowledge about the unconscious mind. This, in first place scientific, study includes an incredible amount of information that can be useful in the issues that we as a graphic designers dealing with. Such as: creativity, actuality, practicality, productivity and many others.</p>

<p>On the way to answering the questions that this thesis raised, first of all will be the defined the unconscious mind. The first chapter will be telling the concept of the human brain phenomena from different angle and perspective. By describing the various manifestations and the known processes of the unconscious mind, the reader will gradually get to its form-expression in art. </p>

<p>Second chapter will be open up further investigation on the scientific research about unconscious mind and in general brain science to art and design. The main sours of the research for it will be: “The Age of Insight: The Quest to Understand the Unconscious in Art, Mind, and Brain, from Vienna 1900 to the Present.” – book by Nobel Prize winner Eric R. Kandel. This book where leaders in science, medicine, and art began a revolution that changed forever how we think about the human mind—our conscious and unconscious thoughts and emotions—and how mind and brain relate to art. Erick R. Kandel brilliantly connected all the points in science and art history that was in common and this exploration of him prissles for this thesis writing.</p>

<p>“The Age of Insight” will give us some examples from painting art and specifically portraiture with in the investigation of the science of the mind by such an artists like Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka and Egon Schiele.</p>

<p>From there on the story will take another part of the psychological study of the mind – Mental imagery (Chapter 3). The knowledge of which is used in lots of way of unconscious manipulation in art and design perception, such as subliminal messaging or ironic process theory, for instance. 
</p>

<p>As more we know as more questions are raised. The mental images are based on the visual information that storage in our memory. In order to explore the income for our memory storage we have to understand the way we receive the information from the environment This process are equipped with sense organs e.g. eye, ear, nose. Each sense organ is part of a sensory system which receives sensory inputs and transmits sensory information to the brain. Chapter 4 will It will be devoted to this topic and also will be exploring the visual memory, bottom up and top-down processes.</p>

<p>The theory that will bring us closer to the conclusion is the Gestalt theory.</p>

<p>The majority of the principles that mind and brain sciences (cognitive psychology with neurology) was opened up for us in last two century will be explored and applied to the creative process of artist and the Beholder’s share. </p>

<p>It is rather critical than objective knowledge but as we will see they cost a lot of power to be known and used, despite its ambiguity. </p>

    <p>In the 1996 movie Mars Attacks! a seemingly friendly representative party(?) from Mars lands its flying saucer in the Nevada(?) desert to meet with humankind. They are warm-heartedly welcomed by an American army general. Although, there is a substantial army present, just in case. News-reporters from all over America are at the scene to report this important occasion, and the eyes of every American are pointed at their television to witness this momentous occasion. When the Martian and human are standing face to face, the human general sticks out his hand in order to give the Martian ambassador a handshake, but this gesture is not recognized by the extraterrestrial. The general then remembers one of the Martians making a circle with its finger in a scene before and continues by doing the same; he forms a circle in the air with his finger, which the Martian repeats. The first understanding between humans and Extraterrestrial has been made. A conversation continues which is translated by a translating machine of which the workings remain unexplained. The Martians announce they come in peace. America breathes a sigh of relief and a long-haired hippie in the crowd releases a white dove to give the moment a symbolic meaning. The dove flaps happily over the ecstatic crowd and is then incinerated by an energybeam originated from the gun of the Martian ambassador. Apparently, the Martians consider a white dove to be an insult of some sorts, after which they declare war on humankind and start the process of extermination.</p>

<p>This scene, however silly and exaggerated the rest of the movie might be, has some interesting points. First of all, the handshake initiated by the general. A handshake is a gesture of which the origins can be traced back all the way to the ancient Greeks(img). It is usually meant as a way of introducing oneself into a social situation. It is believed that the origins of the handshake lie in the ancient etiquette of soldiers.  To show to one another that one has empty hands and carries no weapons. But, handshakes are known to spread germs, which can be some of the most powerful weapons, looking at what happened to Native Americans when Europeans arrived (source). For the possibility of exotic diseases alone, it should be considered to initially avoid any sort of physical contact. 
In other words, to have contact from a safe distance, until we are sure we won’t kill eachother with our germs. The relevance of the handshake is based on the shared knowledge of both the receiving and innitiating party that when one sticks his hand out towards the other, that hand is supposed to be grabbed by the opposite hand of the other after which both hands are shaken up and down by an agreeable amount of time. Sometimes this up and down movement is only done once(img), sometimes the movement continues while a conversation is struck up(img), and sometimes one of the participants adds a little flair to it by putting his other hand in the mix(img). But even as simple a gesture as a handshake can end up in an awkward situation when different cultures  with different customs meet(img). Either way, this seemingly small gesture, that has many variations already, has a lot of cultural and social relevance, to humans that is. When meeting with a lifeform from another planet, chances are small they will understand the significance and meaning of it. Also, they might not have hands. Or they might see the hand as a weapon and the pointing of it as an act of agression. There are many thinkable ways in which the physical act of shaking hands can be interpreted negatively. This tells us that it is important to keep in mind that an extraterrestrial lifeform might have a completely different physical appearance than ours, an anthropocentric approach to any form of communication and/or design is therefore discouraged. The problem that gives us is how to translate a simple message like a handshake to something non-anthropocentric. </p>

<p>The Martian does have hands though, but he doesn't seem to understand the gesture of the handshake, the general therefore continues by pointing his finger in the air and moving it in the motion of a full circle, which the Martian repeats (img). This is actually a more realistic portrayal of how humans could initiate contact with extraterrestrials, seeing as many scientists agree that the language of physics and mathemetics is a universal one, as these are mostly constant throughout the universe. (SOURCE?) A circle, for example, is abundant in the universe. In fact, one of the first proposals for actually communicating with extraterrestrial lifeforms was done in 1820 by German mathemetician Carl Friedrich Gauss (time) who, in an attempt to create what might be considered one of the largest pieces of land art ever, suggested to cut down an enormous portion of a Siberian forest in the shape of a triangle with three rectangles attached to it and replant the area with wheat. (The choice for wheat was because of the contrast in color it would create with the trees). These shapes seen from space would suggest an understanding of the Pythagorean theorem, a mathemetical equation that only an intelligent lifeform could be capable of understanding. According to Carl, they would be large enough to be seen by life-forms on the Moon or Mars. A similar proposal came from Joseph Johann Littrow (TIME), although his was a bit more extreme. He suggested to dig enormous 30 kilometer wide canals in various geometric shapes in the Saharan desert, fill them with kerosene, and light them on fire. This to create giant signal fires which, ofcourse, would show any extraterrestrial paying attention a sign of human intelligence on Earth. 
These ideas were never put into practise, and for environmental reasons, probably never will be, but they are a good indication of how even in the early days of space exploration the language of mathemetics was already considered a viable candidate as a form of communication with extraterrestrial lifeforms. Especially if the intention of our communication is to make ourselves known in the universe. If can be used as a means of telling any ET that is listening or watching that there is (fairly) intelligent life here on Earth. Next to mathematics, It is also important to note that the language of sciences such as physics and chemistry is, as far as we know, consistent throughout the universe, and can in such way also be used to communicate. But after making ourselves known by means of mathemetics or a different scientific language, how we will be able to express ourselves? Science might not be enough to communicate more complex concepts and ideas, like emotions and culture.</p>

<p>(sidenote?) The thing is, nowadays we won’t need to make these kind of landmarks to show our existence, since we already have(img Zuid-Holland). Any Martian with a telescope strong enough will be able to see our presence here on Earth. Our cities are growing bigger and bigger and emit enormous amounts of artificial light. In this way we are already communicating our presence, just not with any intentional message.</p>

<p>The next part in this fictional encounter between humans and Martians is one of miscommunication. The white dove is one of the many kinds of birds that inhabit our planet, but to us humans, it has a special meaning. It is a symbol of peace that has been taught to us by cultural knowledge in the community we live in. When using a model like that of Saussure (source) to analyse the symbolic meaning of a white dove, it can be said that the white dove in its form is the signifier and the concept of peace is the signified. To us, a white dove symbolizes peace, love and good intentions. During the evolution of human cultures, the world has become saturated with these kind of symbols, we have given meaning to virtually every object, gesture and living thing thinkable. (quote; we think only in signs) A finger of the hand can either offend(img), support(img Nina) or direct(img), and depending on the culture, these meaning assigned to these fingers can differ.</p>

<h1>“WE THINK ONLY IN SIGNS” <br />- Charles Sanders Peirce</h1>

<p>The Martians, however, haven't had the same cultural evolution as we did and to them the dove could signify a completely different concept. In this case it's apparently the opposite of peace. Or they might have recognized the dove as a weapon of some sorts, seeing as it is highly improbable there are white doves on Mars. Thinking that extraterrestrials will understand any of our own habitual ways of communication might prove to be a big misconception. The arrow on the pioneer plaque for example (img), is a typical anthropocentric symbol, which is derived from our historic usage of arrows for hunting, and which to us has become a way of pointing out a certain direction. To us, this seems clear, but to a lifeform that has another way of conveying direction it might be confusing.
A way to solve this would be to explain how an arrow works. In a static way, this could be done by looking at the universe and its many occurences in which direction plays an important part. The orbits of planets, or the path of a meteoroid. These can be used to explain the directional message of an arrow. (example)</p>
